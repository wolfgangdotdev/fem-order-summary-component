## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
- NPM

### What I learned

I decided to use this project as my first foray into SCSS. I watched a few YouTube tutorials to get an idea of the syntax and how to stucture the folders and files. I really like the ability to nest selectors within one another, that's very useful, but I did find having to chop and change between so many files frustrating at times. Overall I think it's a bit too verbose for a single component like this one, but I could definitely see the value as websites start to get more complex.

While I was working out how everything fit together I decided to make a [SCSS template](https://github.com/wolfgangdotdev/scss-template) that I can generate a new repo through on GitHub, including a handful of NPM packages for running a live server for automatic SCSS recompilation and watcing for changes in the codebase.

### Useful resources

- [Coder Coder's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCoderCoder) had some very helpful videos on the basics of SCSS. She explains concepts in a very easy to follow way, such that I was up and running with SCSS in a short amount of time, despite never having used it before.
